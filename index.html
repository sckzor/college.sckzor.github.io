<h1> Hello Colleges, </h1>

<p> I understand that you have limited time to vet individual applications.  That said, I hope that you will look into some of the projects I have created.  I feel that my development of these projects sets me apart as an applicant and I would greatly appreciate it if you take a look at them. </p>

<p> In order to aid you in reviewing my projects, I have compiled a list of five of them that I believe accurately represent different, unique aspects of what I make.  For each project I have written a single page overview document that includes a concise one paragraph overview of the accomplishment as well as two other sections that each provide a more detailed overview of a skill I learned.  This is by no means an exhaustive list of things I have made, however I do think, together, they accurately reflect my depth and breadth of knowledge. </p>
<p> Each of the following links leads to a PDF of the corresponding project:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="pdf/Vehicle%20Predictive%20Maintenance%20Brochure.pdf"> Vehicle Predictive Maintenance </a> </li>
	<li> <a href="pdf/Real-Time%20Linux%20Quadcopter%20Brochure.pdf"> Real Time Linux Quadcopter </a> </li>
	<li> <a href="pdf/2.4%20GHz%20Radar%20System%20Brochure.pdf"> 2.4 GHz Radar System </a> </li>
	<li> <a href="pdf/WiFi%20Tracking%20System%20Brochure.pdf"> WiFi Tracking System </a> </li>
	<li> <a href="pdf/Vulkan%203D%20Renderer%20Brochure.pdf"> Vulkan 3D Renderer </a> </li>

</ul>

<p> Thank you for any and all consideration of these projects as part of my applications! </p>
