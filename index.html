<h2 class="rainbow"> ATTENTION! </h2>
<p> Unfortunately, some time on the fateful night of March 2nd, 2024 the motherboard on my trusty webserver died.  I have a warm spare server and all of my data is backed up, however, due to my current personal circumstances I do not have the time to reconfigure another instance of my custom web server, NGINX, firewall and other utilites I run.  Instead, I opted to temporarily bring up this web page in it's place so (mainly colleges) can still see it. Other than this message (and a few other things) this page is left untouched and the links on the page (sans the college one) now lead to the WayBack machine's archive from March 1st.  Although this is no substitute for the original page, it hopefully gives a good idea of what it was like.  The original should make a return in April or May 2024.  Sorry.  <p>

		<p> Hello and welcome to my website. It serves mainly as a catalog for
 the different things that I do.  I tried to keep the interface simple 
and usable.  Check projects for a list of the projects I have completed,
 posts for blog-like posts, links for links to other sites I like, 
kernel for a list of Linux kernel contributions and about for a bunch of
 rambling about myself.  I also have a status in the box to the right as
 well as some updates under it.  Have fun!</p>
		<h3> Colleges </h3>
		<p> Feel free to look around here, but if you have come in search of my projects please check out <a class="rainbow" href="college.html">college.sckz.org</a> first.  It has more detailed and concise summaries that are much closer to what you are probably looking for.  Thanks! </p>
